\begin{abstract}
This is a simple LaTeX document created to demonstrate the basics of LaTeX. It includes a title, an abstract, sections, and some basic text formatting.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction section. LaTeX is a typesetting system that is widely used for producing scientific and mathematical documents due to its powerful handling of formulas and bibliographies.

\section{Basic Text Formatting}
You can make text \textbf{bold}, \textit{italic}, or \underline{underlined}.

\section{Mathematics}
LaTeX is excellent for typesetting mathematics. For example, here is an inline equation: \( E = mc^2 \). And here is a displayed equation:
\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} \, dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
\]

\section{Figures}
You can also include figures in your document. Here is an example of how to include a figure:
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example-image}
    \caption{An example image.}
    \label{fig:example}
\end{figure}

\section{References and Hyperlinks}
You can add references and hyperlinks to your document. For example, visit \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{LaTeX Project} for more information.
